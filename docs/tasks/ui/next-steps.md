‚óè Great question! Now that we have a complete component library with 29 components, here are the logical next
  steps:

  Immediate Next Steps (Phase 5)

  Testing & Documentation
  - Set up component testing with @web/test-runner
  - Create Storybook stories for component documentation
  - Add comprehensive README with usage examples
  - Set up automated testing pipeline

  Integration & Examples
  - Create demo applications showing the components in action
  - Build a complete hyperlinks management app using the components
  - Add integration guides for popular frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)

  Potential Phase 6 Options

  Backend Integration
  - Create API integration utilities for the components
  - Add real data fetching and state management
  - Implement actual QR code generation (vs current placeholder)
  - Add real authentication flows

  Advanced Features
  - Custom domain management components
  - Advanced analytics with charts (Chart.js/D3 integration)
  - Bulk import/export functionality
  - Team collaboration features
  - API key management interface

  Developer Experience
  - CLI tool for component scaffolding
  - VSCode extension for component snippets
  - Figma design system integration
  - Component playground/sandbox
